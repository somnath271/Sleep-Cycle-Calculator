        <h2>About Sleep</h2>
        <p>
          Sleep is a vital component of overall health and well-being. It is
          during sleep that our bodies repair muscles, consolidate memories, and
          release hormones that regulate growth and appetite. Without adequate
          sleep, our cognitive functions, mood, and physical health can be
          adversely affected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, quality sleep contributes to improved mental health,
          increased productivity, and a stronger immune system.

      <section id="sleep-cycles" class="border border-success">
        <h2>Understanding Sleep Cycles</h2>
        <p>
          Sleep occurs in cycles, typically lasting about 90 minutes each. Each
          cycle includes different stages, from light sleep to deep sleep and
          REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. Understanding these cycles can help
          you plan your sleep to wake up feeling refreshed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deep sleep is crucial for physical recovery and growth, while REM
          sleep is essential for cognitive functions such as memory and
          creativity.

      <section id="circadian-rhythms" class="border border-success">
        <h2>Importance of Circadian Rhythms</h2>
        <p>
          Circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles that are part of the body's
          internal clock, running in the background to carry out essential
          functions and processes. One of the most important and well-known
          circadian rhythms is the sleep-wake cycle. Aligning your sleep
          schedule with your circadian rhythm can improve sleep quality and
          overall health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disruptions in circadian rhythms can lead to sleep disorders,
          metabolic issues, and mood disturbances.

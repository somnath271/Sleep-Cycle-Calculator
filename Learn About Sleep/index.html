        <h2>What is Sleep?</h2>
        <p>
          Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized
          by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity,
          reduced muscle activity, and inhibition of nearly all voluntary
          muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. It is essential for the
          body's recovery and proper functioning.
        </p>

      <section id="importance-of-sleep" class="section">
        <h2>The Importance of Sleep</h2>
        <p>
          Sleep plays a crucial role in good health and well-being throughout
          your life. It protects mental health, physical health, quality of
          life, and safety. The way you feel while you're awake depends in part
          on what happens while you're sleeping. During sleep, your body is
          working to support healthy brain function and maintain your physical
          health.

      <section id="sleep-cycles" class="section">
        <h2>Understanding Sleep Cycles</h2>
        <p>
          Sleep occurs in a series of cycles of REM (rapid eye movement) and
          non-REM sleep. Typically, you cycle through five stages of sleep:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stage 1: Light sleep, drifting in and out, and can be awakened
            easily.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stage 2: Eye movements stop, and brain waves become slower with
            occasional bursts of rapid waves.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stage 3: Deep sleep begins. Slow brain waves called delta waves are
            interspersed with smaller, faster waves.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stage 4: Very deep sleep. The brain produces delta waves
            exclusively. Difficult to wake someone up during this stage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stage 5: REM sleep. Breathing becomes more rapid, irregular, and
            shallow, eyes jerk rapidly, and limb muscles become temporarily
            paralyzed.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Circadian Rhythms</h2>
        <p>
          Circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles that are part of the bodyâ€™s
          internal clock, running in the background to carry out essential
          functions and processes. One of the most important and well-known
          circadian rhythms is the sleep-wake cycle.

      <section id="health-benefits" class="section">
        <h2>Health Benefits of Good Sleep</h2>
        <p>
          Getting enough quality sleep at the right times helps you function
          well throughout the day. People who are sleep deficient are less
          productive at work and school. They take longer to finish tasks, have
          a slower reaction time, and make more mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>Good sleep has many benefits, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improved memory and cognitive function</li>
          <li>Better mood regulation</li>
          <li>Enhanced physical performance</li>
          <li>Stronger immune system</li>
          <li>Lower risk of chronic diseases</li>

        <h2>Common Sleep Disorders</h2>
        <p>
          Many people experience sleep disorders at some point in their lives.
          Common sleep disorders include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Insomnia: Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep</li>
          <li>Sleep Apnea: Breathing interruptions during sleep</li>
          <li>
            Restless Legs Syndrome: Uncomfortable sensations in the legs with an
            urge to move them
          </li>
          <li>
            Narcolepsy: Excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden sleep attacks
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to seek
          medical advice.
